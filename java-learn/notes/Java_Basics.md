# Basic Java Interview Questions

## Q1. What is the output of below code

String a = "Hello"; \
a.concat("World");  \
System.out.println(a); 

### Output:
Hello

### Explanation:
Because String is immutable in java when we did a.concat("World"), it creates a new String "HelloWorld" in General Heap area.


## Q2. Will the output of below code

import java.util.*;

class A {
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("Hello, this is class A");
  }
}

class B extends A {
  protected void display() {
    System.out.println("Hello, this is class B");
  }
}


public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      B obj = new B();
      obj.display();
      
    }
}

### Output:
Main.java:10: error: display() in B cannot override display() in A
  protected void display() {
                 ^
  attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public
1 error

### Explanation
The subclass overriding the superclass method should have the broader access priviledges than the superclass method
for eg. if protected is in super class, then public in subclass. 


## Q3. What is the output of below code

class A {
  static void display() {
    System.out.println("Hello, this is class A");
  }
}

class B extends A {
  static void display() {
    System.out.println("Hello, this is class B");
  }
}


public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      A a = new B();
      a.display();
    }
}

### Output:
Hello, this is class A

### Explanation
This concept is called Method Hiding.
Because display() is static, the compiler looks at the reference type (class A). It says, "Okay, this is a class A reference, so I am going to call the display() method that belongs to the class A." It does not care that the object created is of class B.

## Q4. What is the output of below code

class A {
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("Hello, this is class A");
  }
}

class B extends A {
   public void display() {
    System.out.println("Hello, this is class B");
  }
}


public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      A a = new B();
      a.display();
    }
}

### Output:
Hello, this is class B

### Explanation
This concept is called method overriding. JVM decides at runtime which class method to call. Here B's method is called. This is called dynamic method dispatch or runtime polymorphism.


## Difference between compile time polymorphism and Runtime Polymorphism
1. Method Hiding = Compile-Time Polymorphism
When you call a static method, the Java compiler looks at the reference type (the "label" on the variable) at the time you compile your code.

Why it's Compile-Time: The compiler essentially replaces the method call with the specific class method address during the compilation phase. It does not need to know what kind of object is in that variable at runtime; it only cares about the type of the variable itself.

Key Characteristic: The decision is "locked in" before the program even runs.

2. Method Overriding = Runtime Polymorphism
When you call an instance (non-static) method, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks at the actual object stored in memory at the exact moment the line is executed.

Why it's Runtime: The program doesn't know which version of the method to run until it actually "looks" inside the memory to see if the object is an instance of Class A or Class B. This is handled by the JVM's virtual method table (vtable).

Key Characteristic: The decision is "deferred" until the program is actively running.
